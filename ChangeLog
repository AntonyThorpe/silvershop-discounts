* Allow coupon to be removed with standard modifier removal method.

* Apply coupon only to specific products, or ranges of products.

* Buy x "foo", and get y "bar" for free. Could this be done by creating dummy orderitems?
	-ie: OrderCupon $has_many = array('FreeItems' => 'OrderItem');
	-"foo" could be nothing

* improve cmsFields
* Prevent creating a cupon with the same code

Changes:
* Renamed every instance of DiscountCoupon (or similar) to OrderCoupon
