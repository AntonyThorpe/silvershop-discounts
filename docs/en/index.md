# Discounts

Discounts come in two forms:

 * Temporary price markdown on one or many products - displayed on front-end, and may vary, depending on logged in member
 * Coupon/Voucher codes - unique code entered at checkout


## Vouchers

### Setup Options

 * Code (always required). By default a coupon code is 10 characters long.
 * Number of uses - unlimited, or a certian number of uses
 * Use period - specify a start / end period that the voucher can be used within.
 * Product range
 
### Common use cases
 
  * Unique coupon codes per customer, for a one-time sale.
  * Single coupon code, with an expiry date, to be used by many people.
