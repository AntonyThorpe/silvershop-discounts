# TODO

 * Track redeems - who has used a coupon, how long before they used it, total uptake.
 * Restrict to customers, categories, or products
 * Prevent too much being taken off order and unwanted combinations.
 * Automatically remove coupon, when appropriate
 * Gift card creation form...allows you to purchase at checkout.
 * apply to shipping only
 * Log coupon entries - failed and successful
 * Generate barcodes or QR codes
 * Cleaner way to get/set percent values: eg 50% , rather than 0.5
 * Specify product groups/categories to apply to, rather than single items
